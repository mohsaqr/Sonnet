Description: Tools for the analysis, visualization, and manipulation of dynamical,
    social, and complex networks. Provides comprehensive network metrics including
    centrality measures, motif analysis, community detection, and network comparison.
    Features a validation engine with bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation
    testing, and centrality stability analysis. Supports multiple input formats
    (adjacency matrices, edge lists, igraph objects) and offers flexible tools for
    heterogeneous, multi-layer, and hierarchical network analysis. Includes
    publication-ready plotting with customizable layouts, node shapes, edge styles,
    and themes through an intuitive, pipe-friendly API.
