\arguments{
\item{x}{Network input.}

\item{set1}{Character or integer. First node set (names or indices).}

\item{set2}{Character or integer. Second node set (names or indices).}

\item{...}{Additional filter expressions.}

\item{.keep_isolates}{Keep nodes with no edges? Default FALSE.}

\item{keep_format}{Keep input format? Default FALSE.}

\item{directed}{Auto-detect if NULL.}
}
\value{
A cograph_network with edges between the two node sets.
}
\description{
Select edges connecting two specified node sets.
